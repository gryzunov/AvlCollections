==============

Source code for AVL Tree based collections in C#

1. AvlTree - AVL Tree implementation
2. CompactAvlTree - AVL Tree with compact node representation (without Parent field)
3. AvlTreeDictionary - Dictionary built over AvlTree
4. AvlTreeList - AvlTree with nodes organized as doubly linked list

AvlTree is partially based on Keith Wood work: https://github.com/bitlush/avl-tree-c-sharp
